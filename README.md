- 👋 Hi, I’m @FadyASulaiman
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, machine learning and deep learning
- 🌱 I’m currently shifting my career from backend development to be a machine learning engineer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects and research papers
- 📫 You can reach me on my email: Sulaiman.A.Fady@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm originally a mining/petroleum engineer but tech has always been my passion so it didn't take me long after working in the mining/petroleum field to answer my calling in tech and land my first job as a software developer and the rest is history.
